v0.4 (2017-04-23)
-----------------
* Added data shuffling operators that use RDMA, and in particular UD
  Send/Receive, RC Send/Receive and RC Read. A shuffle operation requires a
  repartition and receive operator pair, or a broadcast and receive pair.
  See drivers/sample_queries/shuffling-query/README.txt for an example.
* Added MPI support, both drivers and data shuffling operators.
* Added TCP/IP shuffling operator.
* Added driver to execute multiple query fragments concurrently.
* Supporting side-by-side compilation for MPI.
* The "consumer" operator now can scan the input multiple times.
* Aggregations now allow for a configurable number of slots per bucket.
* Added repeated partitioned scan operator "repeatpartitionedscan".
* Loading nothing no longer results in an error.
* Renamed "generator_zipf" operator into "zipf_generator".

v0.3 (UNRELEASED)
-----------------
* Hash joins now support composite keys.

v0.2 (2016-05-24)
-----------------
* Added operators to interface with `perf` and extract system and hardware 
  performance counters.
* Added operators to obtain call counts and real-world time per thread per phase.
* Added dedicated in-memory sort operator. No need to invoke PartitionOp only 
  for its side-effect of producing sorted output!
* Added looping scan operator for experiments.
* Changed operator that generated uniformly random numbers. Added version for
  Zipf-distributed values.
* Hash joins can prefetch hash buckets (on both build and probe sides) and
  can control which threads participate on the build and probe subtrees.

v0.1 (2015-02-10)
-----------------
* Initial release.
